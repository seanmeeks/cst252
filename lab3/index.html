		<h2 class="what">What is UNO?</h2>
		<p class="game">
			UNO is a card game most commonly played in groups and at parties. In the game, each player is given 7 of cards at random. The cards range between a variety of colors and numbers. One person starts the game by placing the first card down, revealing the card to everyone. The game continues either clockwise or counterclockwise and each player places a card on top of the other. The cards placed on one another must be either the same color or number. The first person with one card in the end must shout "UNO" in order for them to win the game. UNO also has a few of trick cards that may either set players back or move them forward in the game. The type of cards each player receives is entirely random (unless they're a cheater!). </p>

		<h2>Answers to Questions</h2>
		<ul>
			<li><b>What actions can I take?</b></li>
			<p>Collecting your cards and organizing them by color & if you have ‘+4’ cards then keeping those separate</p>
			<li><b>What do I need to remember or keep track of?</b></li>
			<p>You need to remember that you want to get rid of your cards as fast as you can but also want to give whoever you're playing against more cards. That can be down by +2 or +4 cards.</p>
			<li><b>What actions do I repeat?</b></li>
			<p>Placing down cards and picking up cards from the fresh deck if you have nothing to put down</p>
			<li><b>When do I need to make decisions?</b></li>
			<p>As soon as it’s your turn.</p>

		<h2>Pseudocoding</h2>
		<ol class="plist" type="1">
  		<li>One player shuffles the UNO card deck, then distributes 7 cards to each other player at random.</li>
  		<li>Players are recommended to keep their cards confidential.</li>
  		<li>Once each player has a card, the one player puts down one card facing up, and the game starts.</li>
			<li>The game continues clockwise, the next player puts down a card that has either the same number color attached to it.</li>
			<li>The following  player does the same, players have the potential to also place action cards that throw off the game (draw 4, draw 2, color change, reverse direction, skip a turn, and more).</li>
			<li>If a player puts down an action card, the next player has to follow the instructions (either draw two cards, skip their turn, etc.).</li>
			<li>The game continues this way until someone reaches one card.</li>
			<li>When one player successfully has only one card left in their deck, they win the game.</li>
