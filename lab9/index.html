		<p>The goal of Lab 9 is to practice creating events in the Javascript file and make it so that when we interact with something in the page, something else happens.
</p>
			<h2 class="problems">Problems</h2>
		<p>When completing this lab, I did not run into any problems that we didnâ€™t end solve before completion. I ran into errors when using the addEventListener element to the Javascript, but soon found that it was because I had not defined the element in the code prior. After the error was corrected the code ran smoothly.
</p>
			<h2 class="results">Results</h2>
			<p>The results can be shown when clicking the button below or mousing over the page.
