	<h2>Challenge</h2>
		<p>The goal of Lab 8 was to experiment with new commands using Javascript. We were to use Javascript to make changes in the index by creating two buttons and changing their CSS elements.
		</p>
			<h2>Problems</h2>
		<p>When completing this lab, we ran into errors trying to get the buttons to show up on our websites with the code that we currently in our lab8.js. Task 2 was more difficult than the labs prior and we were curious as to why the content isnâ€™t showing up in the index.html on the browser. </p>
			<h2>Results</h2>
			<p>The results of this lab can be seen on this page and with the button below. The results of the Javascript file can be seen in the Sources panel of the inspector or in the screenshots of the Lab 8 submission.</p>
